# Marks Navigation for Inkdrop

Helps you navigate to highlights/marks, by rendering all your marks in a single section as clickable links.

## Requirements

You'll need a different plugin to provide marking/highlighting. Any that renders a `<mark>` element should work, but this plugin was ==tested with 'inkdrop-mark-text'==.

## Install

```
ipm install marks-nav
```

## Usage

To insert your marks, create a heading with the value `marks` (case-insensitive), and all your marks in the note will be shown below it in block quotes.

## Roadmap

Possible features to be implemented:

- Shortcut to jump through marks
- Click a mark to go back to list
- Shortcut to go to marks list
